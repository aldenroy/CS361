# CS361
We will use teams for commmunication. For responsiveness, members should respond to messages the same day/within 24 hours of receiving the message. For meetings, we will define a regular meeting schedule that works for all team members and ensures that everyone can plan their availability and participation. For task division we can use a rotating system to basically bounce our work back and forth to each other when one person needs to work on the microservice for the other. If a conflict arises we will involve open discussions, or seek input from the instructor.
